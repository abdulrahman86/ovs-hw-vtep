  <p>
    This schema specifies relations that a VTEP can use to integrate
    physical ports into logical switches maintained by a network
    virtualization controller such as NVP.

  <p>Glossary:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>VTEP</dt>
    <dd>
      VXLAN Tunnel End Point, an entity which originates and/or terminates
      VXLAN tunnels.
    </dd>

    <dt>HSC</dt>
    <dd>
      Hardware Switch Controller.
    </dd>

    <dt>NVC</dt>
    <dd>
      Network Virtualization Controller, e.g. NVP.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <table name="Global" title="Top-level configuration.">
    Top-level configuration for a hardware VTEP.  There must be
    exactly one record in the <ref table="Global"/> table.

    <column name="switches">
      The physical switches managed by the VTEP.
    </column>

    <group title="Database Configuration">
      <p>
        These columns primarily configure the Open vSwitch database
        (<code>ovsdb-server</code>), not the hardware VTEP itself.
      </p>

      <column name="managers">
        Database clients to which the Open vSwitch database server should
        connect or to which it should listen, along with options for how these
        connection should be configured.  See the <ref table="Manager"/> table
        for more information.
      </column>
    </group>
  </table>

  <table name="Physical_Switch" title="A physical switch.">
    A physical switch within the domain of the VTEP.

    <column name="ports">
      The physical ports within the switch.
    </column>

    <group title="Identification">
      <column name="name">
	Symbolic name for the switch, such as its hostname.
      </column>
      
      <column name="description">
	An extended description for the switch, such as its switch login
	banner.
      </column>
    </group>
  </table>

  <table name="Physical_Port" title="A port within a physical switch.">
    A port within a <ref table="Physical_Switch"/>.

    <column name="vlan_to_logical_switch">
      Identifies a binding of logical switch to VLANs on the physical port.
      If, for example, the map contains a (VLAN, logical switch) pair, a
      packet that arrives on the port in the VLAN is considered to belong to
      the paired logical switch.
    </column>

    <group title="Identification">
      <column name="name">
	Symbolic name for the port.  The name ought to be unique within a given
	<ref table="Physical_Switch"/>, but the database is not capable of
	enforcing this.
      </column>
      
      <column name="description">
	An extended description for the port.
      </column>
    </group>
  </table>

  <table name="Logical_Switch" title="A layer-2 domain.">
    A logical Ethernet switch, whose implementation may span physical and
    virtual media, possibly crossing L3 domains via tunnels; a logical layer-2
    domain; an Ethernet broadcast domain.

    <column name="mac_locations">
      Identifies the physical location at which given Ethernet unicast,
      multicast, or broadcast addresses are known to reside, functioning in a
      way analogous to a MAC learning table for a logical switch.
    </column>

    <column name="ipv4_locations">
      Identifies the physical location at which given IPv4 addresses are known
      to reside, allowing for ARP suppression.
    </column>

    <column name="ipv6_locations">
      Identifies the physical location at which given IPv6 addresses are known
      to reside, allowing for IPv6 neighbor discovery suppression.
    </column>

    <group title="Identification">
      <column name="name">
	Symbolic name for the logical switch.
      </column>
      
      <column name="description">
	An extended description for the logical switch, such as its switch
	login banner.
      </column>

  </table>

  <table name="Physical_Locator">
    A tunnel or some equivalent (e.g. collection of tunnels bundled together
    for robustness against failure).

    <column name="encapsulation_type">
      The type of tunneling encapsulation.
    </column>

    <column name="vtep_ip_address">
      For <code>vxlan_over_ipv4</code> encapsulation, the IPv4 address of the
      VXLAN tunnel endpoint.
